Project Flotta is designed to manage containerized workload on small-footprint devices found on the edges of networks by managing the lifecycle of edge-focused operating systems and securing connectivity between K8s/OCP and the edge. Flotta provides a pipeline for operating system images across ARM and x86 architectures and enables atomic upgrades and rollbacks of an edge-focused operating system, while maintaining a minimal footprint. Because edge computing networks have the potential for instability, Flotta can provide continuity when connectivity is sporadic or down for long periods of time. Enhanced edge observability is also provided through improved metrics and log collection capabilities.
